This example assumes you have recent versions flex and g++ installed on your computer.
If you're unfamiliar with these tools, then you can only benefit by first looking and working
through the micro-scheme example first.
To compile and see it in action, type the following at the command prompt:

> flex mini-scheme.l
> g++ -o mini-scheme lex.yy.c -lfl
> ./mini-scheme mini-scheme-example.scm

cs143-examples hosts the collection of larger examples I plan
on using when I teach Stanford Course CS143.  This file will
be updated to reflect the order in which the examples are
used.

Lexical Analysis:
- micro-scheme 
   Introduces a trivial Scheme-like language to illustrate the
   basic ideo of how flex works.
- mini-scheme
   Slightly more elaborate example illustrating how yylex--the
   lexing function that flex creates for you--can be used to
   extract information about all of the tokens one after another.
   In practice, the parser (either a hand-written one, or a
   yacc/bison-generated one) repeatedly calls this yylex function
   to get the series of tokens.
